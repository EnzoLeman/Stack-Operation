# Stack Operation in Java

This repository contains an implementation of basic stack operations in Java. It includes classes and methods for performing operations like PUSH, POP, isFull, isEmpty, and more, designed for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features
- Object-oriented implementation of a stack.
- Example usage with a main program.
- Well-structured and easy-to-understand code.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
